# Secret-Weapon-App

### What is this?

The Secret Weapon is the name used for combining the Getting Things Done (gtd) meethodology with the software Evernote.
They called it the Secret Weapon because it is like a extremely useful combination of tools and systems for organization and productivity.
I absolutely love the GTD methodology and I used to enjoy using Evernote. However, I do not think that Evernote is set up in such a way as to
be used efficiently with GTD. Evernote's Notebooks and tags are able to be used with GTD but they're not optimized for GTD, that is where this software will
come into play. I am currently designing this app to be used specificly with the evernote system.

I'm sure it will be a rough project for the meantime as I still have a lot to learn but I will continue working on this until it is near perfect and then I'll look into launching it so other people can enjoy the amazing system of GTD with software that is specifically designed for it.
